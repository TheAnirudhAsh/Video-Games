Hello!
Welcome to my Github.

You will find a Python3 script in this repository which shows a basic exploratory data analysis I conducted on a video games
data set I found on Kaggle.


A huge thanks to my friend and former-colleague Rush Kirubi for putting together this amazing dataset and for 
sharing it on Kaggle.


This is meant to be a tutorial for new learners and beginners who are new to the world of Analysis using Python.


If you have any questions/comments/suggestions please feel free to email me on anirudh.ash2594@gmail.com with the
subject:
	"Github project suggestion"

Thank you and hope you enjoy learning!
